UDBTEY-103	As a user (System), system should be able to capture Primary Applicant's Co-applicant KYC details using their Aadhar number/PAN number/Voter ID/Driver's License/Passport number, so that the primary applicant's KYC can be completed successfully.	High	Ready for review	"As a Business executive, I need the ability to select Passport (Voter ID) as the Proof of Identity (POI) type and capture the Primary Applicant's Voter ID number using various methods, ensuring that the KYC (Know Your Customer) check can be effectively conducted. This feature should be integrated into the Front-End (FE) App, providing options to either capture a photo of the Voter ID for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or manually enter the Voter ID number. The system should also automatically set the POI type as Proof of Address (POA) when Voter ID is selected as the POI.

Pre-Conditions to Test:
1. The user has logged in to the Front-End (FE) App.
2. The system is operational and integrated with the necessary FinTech API for OCR.
3. The user is on the screen where POI selection and Voter ID capture take place.
4. The Voter ID document (physical or digital) is available for capturing the photo."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements:

1. Integration with Front-End (FE) App:
   - The FE App must be integrated with the system to facilitate user interactions and input for selecting Passport as the Proof of Identity (POI) type and capturing the Voter ID.

2. Integration with FinTech API for OCR:
   - The system must be integrated with a FinTech API that provides Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities. This integration is crucial for capturing and processing Voter ID information accurately.

End-to-End Integration Requirements:

1. **User Authentication and Access:**
   - Ensure that users have appropriate authentication and access rights to use the FE App and access the KYC-related functionality.

2. Data Aggregator Integration (if applicable):
   - If the system is configured to capture additional fields via OCR from a data aggregator, ensure that the integration with the data aggregator is in place and functioning correctly.

3. Availability of Voter ID Document:
   - For test cases involving capturing a photo of the Voter ID document, make sure that a sample Voter ID document (either physical or digital) is available for testing.

4. OCR Service Availability (if external):
   - If the OCR service used is external, validate that it is available and responsive during testing to ensure successful OCR processing."	TC-01	"Select ""Voter ID"" as POI type"	"Dropdown selection: ""Voter ID"""	"POI type is set to ""Voter ID"""	Positive
