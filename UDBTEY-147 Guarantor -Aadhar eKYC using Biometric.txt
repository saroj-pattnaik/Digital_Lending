UDBTEY-147	As a Business executive I should be able to click the photo of the manual consent form signed by the Primary applicant in the FOS app so that the Primary applicant consent can be captured successfully.	Low	Ready for review	"This user story focuses on enabling the lending system to automatically initiate Aadhar eKYC for Guarantors when their Aadhar number is captured in the Customer Consent screen. The goal is to ensure a successful completion of the Guarantor's KYC process. It outlines the scope, validation, integrations, and acceptance criteria for this feature.

Pre-Conditions to Test:
1. The lending application must be in a functional state.
2. The Business executive must have access to the FinTech API page.
3. Aadhaar number or Virtual ID must be captured in the Customer Consent screen.
4. A biometric device must be available for fingerprint capture.
5. The UIDAI integration via FinTech API must be properly configured.
6. The Aadhaar vault integration must be set up.
7. The eKYC timer should be configurable.
8. The system should be capable of handling eKYC retries and CKYC initiation.
9. The eKYC timer must be set to a predefined value (e.g., 60 seconds) as mentioned in the user story.
"	"Product-to-Product Integrations Requirements:
1. FinTech API Integration:
   - The lending application must have a seamless integration with the FinTech API to initiate eKYC processes.
   - Ensure that the API endpoints and methods for initiating eKYC and receiving responses are properly integrated.

2. UIDAI Integration:
   - The system should be integrated with UIDAI for Aadhaar verification and eKYC data retrieval.
   - Validate that the system can make API requests to UIDAI and handle responses accurately.

3. Aadhaar Vault Integration:
   - If an Aadhaar vault system is used for securely storing Aadhaar data, ensure it is properly integrated into the lending application.
   - Verify that the application can securely access and retrieve Aadhaar information from the vault when required.

End-to-End Integrations Requirements:

1. Biometric Device Integration:
   - The lending application must be able to interface with a biometric device for fingerprint capture.
   - Validate that the biometric device is connected and operational during testing.

2. Database Integration:
   - Verify that the lending application can store and retrieve eKYC response data in the database.
   - Ensure data integrity and consistency in the database.

3. User Interface (UI) Integration:
   - Check that the eKYC screen is seamlessly integrated into the user interface (UI) of the lending application.
   - Validate that eKYC-related data is displayed correctly on the UI.

4. Configuration Management:
   - Ensure that the eKYC timer is configurable and can be set to the predefined value as mentioned in the user story.
   - Validate that configuration changes take effect as expected.

5. Error Handling and Logging:
   - Verify that the lending application is integrated with a logging system to capture errors and exceptions.
   - Ensure that appropriate error messages and logs are generated in case of integration failures.

6. CKYC Integration:
   - If cKYC initiation is part of the requirements, ensure that the lending application can seamlessly switch to cKYC when needed.
   - Validate that the transition from eKYC to cKYC is smooth and well-documented"	TC01	Verify successful eKYC initiation with valid data	- Business executive on FinTech API page<br>- Valid Aadhaar number/VID<br>- Successful UIDAI API response	eKYC response data displayed, proceed to QDE	Positive
