UDBTEY-133	As a Business executive I should be able to select POI(proof of identity) type so that Manual KYC can be conducted on it	High	Ready For Review	"This user story involves the implementation of a feature within the Front-End (FE) App of a digital lending application. Business executives using the application should have the capability to select a Proof of Identity (POI) type, which is a crucial step in the manual KYC (Know Your Customer) process. The user is presented with a dropdown menu containing various POI options, including Aadhaar (Preferred), Driver's License, Passport, Voter ID, and NREGA. The system is designed to integrate with the Loan Origination System (LOS) to auto-populate POI details if they were previously captured, simplifying the manual KYC process. Furthermore, the system is expected to validate the user's selection based on a predefined list of POI types.

Pre-Conditions for Testing:

The digital lending application is accessible and fully operational.
Business executives have valid login credentials and access permissions.
The user is on the KYC screen or a relevant section where POI selection is required.
The predefined list of POI types (Aadhaar, Driver's License, Passport, Voter ID, NREGA) is available for selection.
Integration with the Loan Origination System (LOS) is properly configured and functional.
For Scenario 1 of the acceptance criteria, relevant POI details have been previously captured for the selected POI type.
For Scenario 2 of the acceptance criteria, no relevant POI details have been previously captured, and the system is ready to prompt the user for data input.
Business executives are familiar with the application's KYC process and the available POI types.
The application allows users to navigate to the POI selection screen and proceed with manual KYC checks."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements:
