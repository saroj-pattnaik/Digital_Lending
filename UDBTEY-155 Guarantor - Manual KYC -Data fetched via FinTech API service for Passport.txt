UDBTEY-155	As a user (System), should be able to fetch and verify Guarantors details from the Data aggregator response, so that the Manual KYC can be completed successfully	Low	Ready for review	"The user story describes the need for a system to fetch and verify Guarantor details from a Data aggregator response in order to successfully complete the Manual KYC process. It includes the scope of required input fields, integration with Data aggregators via a FinTech API, and acceptance criteria for two scenarios: one where accurate data is retrieved and another where there's no response or inaccurate data.

Pre-Conditions to Test:

1. The system is properly configured and integrated with Data aggregators via the FinTech API.
2. The user initiating the process has appropriate permissions and access to the Manual KYC functionality.
3. Valid input parameters, such as Passport No. and Expiry date, are provided.
4. Data aggregators are available and responsive during the test.
5. The system interface displays the relevant input fields, checkboxes, and output fields as per the user story's scope.
6. Error handling procedures are in place and configured as needed.
"	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements:

1. API Access: Ensure that the necessary API credentials and access rights are obtained and configured for the integration with the data aggregator.

2. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage various potential issues, including connectivity problems, timeouts, and API errors.

3. Data Mapping: Establish clear data mapping and transformation requirements to ensure that data retrieved from the data aggregator aligns with the system's data model.

End-to-End Integration Requirements:

1. User Interface Integration: Ensure that the user interface elements required to display and verify customer details are integrated seamlessly within the lending application's interface.

2. Database Integration: Establish a connection between the system and the database to store the fetched customer details accurately.

3. Input Parameter Configuration: Configure the system to accept and validate passport-related input parameters, including Passport Number and Expiry Date.

4. Checkbox Implementation: Create a functional checkbox in the user interface for selecting Other Specified Value (OSV) documents.

5.Workflow Integration: Integrate the manual KYC workflow, allowing users to proceed to Quality Data Entry (QDE) based on the accuracy of the displayed customer details.

6. Data Validation: Implement data validation checks to ensure that the data retrieved from the data aggregator aligns with the expected format and content."
