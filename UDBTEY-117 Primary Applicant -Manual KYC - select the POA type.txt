UDBTEY-117	As a Business executive I should be able to select POA(proof of address) type so that Manual KYC can be conducted on it	High	Ready For Review	"In this user story, Business executives using the digital lending application need the capability to select a Proof of Address (POA) type to facilitate Manual KYC processes. Users can choose from a predefined list of POA types, including Aadhaar, Driver's License, Passport, Voter ID, NREGA, and NPR (national population register). The system should also integrate with the Loan Origination System (LOS) to auto-populate POA details if they were previously captured. This feature streamlines the KYC process and ensures that necessary POA information is readily available when conducting manual KYC checks.
Pre-Conditions for Testing:

The digital lending application is accessible and operational.
Business executives have valid login credentials and access to the application.
The user is on the KYC screen or a relevant section where POA selection is required.
The predefined list of POA types (Aadhaar, Driver's License, Passport, Voter ID, NREGA, NPR) is available for selection.
Integration with the Loan Origination System (LOS) is set up and functional.
For Scenario 1 of the acceptance criteria, relevant POA details have been previously captured for the selected POA type.
For Scenario 2 of the acceptance criteria, no relevant POA details have been previously captured, and the system is in a state to prompt the user for data entry.
Test data for LOS integration is available, including cases where POA details were previously captured and where they were not.
Business executives are familiar with the application's KYC process and the available POA types.
The application allows users to navigate to the POA selection screen and proceed with manual KYC checks."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements
