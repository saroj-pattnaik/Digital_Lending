UDBTEY-96	As a Business executive I should be able to select POI(proof of identity) type as Passport, and capture the Guarantor's Passport No. and Expiry Date via various methods so that KYC check can be run			"""As a Business executive, I want to select Passport as the proof of identity (POI) type for Guarantors and capture their Passport Number and Expiry Date using various methods, including OCR, in the Front-End App. This will facilitate the KYC check process.""

Pre-Conditions for Testing:

The Front-End (FE) App is accessible and functional.
Integration with the FinTech OCR API is set up and operational.
The system's POI dropdown menu includes options for Aadhaar, Driver's License, Passport, Voter ID, and NREGA.
The Field List Excel for validation and configuration is available.
Guarantor's Passport document is ready for scanning or manual entry.
The system is properly configured to resize images as required.
The system interface includes a checkbox for ""POI = POA.""
Business executive has access to the user interface for capturing and editing Passport details.
PAN verification process is available for subsequent steps in the workflow."	"Front-End (FE) App to FinTech OCR API Integration:

The FE App should be able to communicate with the FinTech OCR API for document scanning and OCR processing.
Ensure secure and authenticated access between the FE App and the FinTech OCR API.
Validate that the OCR API can handle requests for Passport document scanning.
FE App to Loan Origination System (LOS-SFDC) Integration (if applicable):

If the LOS-SFDC is part of the ecosystem, ensure the FE App can pass captured Passport data to LOS-SFDC for further processing and storage.
Verify that Passport data is correctly mapped to relevant fields in LOS-SFDC.
End-to-End Integration Requirements:

Complete Workflow Integration:

Validate the end-to-end workflow from the point of initiating Passport capture to the PAN verification stage.
Ensure that all integrated components, including the FE App, OCR API, and any back-end systems, work seamlessly together.
Data Flow and Mapping:

Verify that Passport Number and Expiry Date captured through OCR or manual entry are correctly passed to the subsequent stages of the lending process.
Confirm that the data is accurately mapped to the appropriate fields in downstream systems (e.g., LOS-SFDC)."
