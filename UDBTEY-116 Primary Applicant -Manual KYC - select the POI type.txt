UDBTEY-116	As a Business executive I should be able to select POI(proof of identity) type so that Manual KYC can be conducted on it	High	Ready For Review	"In this user story, Business executives using the digital lending application are provided with the capability to select a Proof of Identity (POI) type for the purpose of conducting Manual KYC checks. The user can choose from a predefined list of POI types, including Aadhaar, Driver's License, Passport, Voter ID, and NREGA. The system should also integrate with the Loan Origination System (LOS) to auto-populate POI details if they were previously captured. This feature streamlines the KYC process and ensures that the necessary POI information is readily available when conducting manual KYC checks.
Pre-Conditions for Testing:

The digital lending application is accessible and operational.
Business executives have valid login credentials and access to the application.
The user is on the KYC screen or a relevant section where POI selection is required.
The predefined list of POI types (Aadhaar, Driver's License, Passport, Voter ID, NREGA) is available for selection.
Integration with the Loan Origination System (LOS) is set up and functional.
For Scenario 1 of the acceptance criteria, relevant POI details have been previously captured for the selected POI type.
For Scenario 2 of the acceptance criteria, no relevant POI details have been previously captured, and the system is in a state to prompt the user for data entry.
Test data for LOS integration is available, including cases where POI details were previously captured and where they were not.
Business executives are familiar with the application's KYC process and the available POI types.
The application allows users to navigate to the POI selection screen and proceed with manual KYC checks."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements:
Integration with Loan Origination System (LOS):
The digital lending application must establish a seamless integration with the Loan Origination System (LOS) to retrieve previously captured POI details.

The LOS should provide an API or data exchange mechanism for fetching the required information.

1.User Interface (UI) Development:
2.POI Type Dropdown:
3.Auto-Population of Previously Captured Data (Scenario 1):
4.Prompt for Data Capture (Scenario 2):
