UDBTEY-138	As a Business executive I should be able to capture Co Applicant's Passport during manual KYC procedure, so that the data aggregator check can be run on it	High	Ready For Review	"This user story focuses on the capability for a Business executive to capture the Passport of a Co-Applicant during the manual KYC procedure. The primary goal is to enable the data aggregator check on the Passport document. This involves using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to extract key information, such as the Passport Number and Expiry Date, and facilitating the verification process. The story also highlights the importance of accurate data entry and validation, as well as integration with OCR services and document storage systems.
Pre-conditions for Testing:

System Setup: Ensure that the system is properly configured with the necessary components, including OCR integration with IDFY and a Document Management System (DMS) for storing captured documents.

User Interface: Verify that the user interface (FE App) includes the required elements, such as fields for capturing Passport details and checkboxes for confirming OSV.

Document Availability: Make sure that test Passport documents are readily available for testing purposes, covering scenarios of accurate and inaccurate OCR data extraction.

API Configuration: Confirm that the FinTech API is correctly configured to retrieve data once the manual KYC procedure is initiated.

POI Type Selection: Ensure that the system allows the selection of Passport as the POI (Proof of Identity) type.

POI=POA Checkbox: Verify that the system handles the auto-ticking of the POI=POA checkbox when Passport is selected.

OSV Checkbox: Ensure that the OSV checkbox is functional and can be selected by the Business executive.

Data Correction: Confirm that the system permits manual correction of data if the OCR process does not accurately populate the details.

Testing Environment: Set up a testing environment where these components are available and interact seamlessly.

Passport Documents: Prepare a variety of Passport documents for testing, some with accurate OCR data and others with inaccuracies.

These pre-conditions are essential to ensure that testing of the user story is comprehensive and covers various scenarios and potential challenges."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements:
