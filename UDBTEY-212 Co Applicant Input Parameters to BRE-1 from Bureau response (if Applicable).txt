UDBTEY-212	As a user(System), results from Bureau needs to be taken as an input parameters for BRE-1 so that BRE can consume the feed for scheme approvals	High	Ready for review	"**User Story Description:**
In this user story, the system needs to utilize Bureau results as input parameters for BRE-1 (Business Rules Engine) to support the approval of lending schemes. The scope includes defining the data fields required from the Bureau, integrating the BRE system (CRIF) with the Loan Origination System (LOS), and specifying validation and acceptance criteria for handling various scenarios.

**Testing Preconditions:**
1. The Bureau data source is integrated and operational.
2. The Loan Origination System (LOS) is connected to the BRE system (CRIF).
3. The BRE-1 request can be triggered, and its execution is dependent on Bureau data.
4. A database for storing Bureau results and reports is in place.
5. A mechanism for downloading detailed Bureau reports post-BRE-1 response is available.
6. Quick Data Entry and Scorecard data required to trigger BRE-1 is accessible.
7. A scenario involving a Bureau response of -1 (no customer data received) is simulated for testing."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements:

1. BRE (CRIF) Integration: Ensure that the BRE system (CRIF) is integrated with the Loan Origination System (LOS) to facilitate data exchange seamlessly.

2. Bureau Data Availability: Verify that the Bureau data source is operational and can provide the necessary information required by the user story.

3.Data Format Compatibility: Confirm that the data formats used by the BRE system (CRIF) and LOS are compatible for smooth data transmission.

4. Data Validation: Validate that the data received from the Bureau is accurate, complete, and formatted correctly to meet the input requirements of the BRE-1 process.

End-to-End Integration Requirements:

1. User Account Setup: Ensure that user accounts and permissions are configured correctly for accessing both the LOS and the BRE system (CRIF).

2. Data Flow Testing: Validate that data flows seamlessly from the Bureau to the LOS and subsequently to the BRE-1 process.

3. Response Handling: Verify that the system can handle responses from the Bureau appropriately, including cases where the response is -1 (no customer data received).

4. Report Availability: Confirm that detailed Bureau reports are generated and available for download post-BRE-1 response.

5. Validation Checks: Validate that the system correctly validates the input parameters from the Bureau response before triggering the BRE-1 request."	Scenario 1: Bureau Results/Report stored at the database to trigger BRE-1
