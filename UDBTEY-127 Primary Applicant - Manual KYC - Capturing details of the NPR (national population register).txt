UDBTEY-127	As a Business executive I should be able to capture Primary Applicant's NPR (national population register) during manual KYC procedure, so that Manual KYC can be conducted	Low	Ready for review	"In this user story, a Business executive needs the capability to capture the National Population Register (NPR) details of the Primary Applicant during manual KYC procedures in a lending system. Additionally, the system should allow the upload and storage of Proof of Address (POA) documents. To confirm the completion of OSV, a checkbox will be provided on the screen. This functionality will facilitate accurate KYC processes and move the system to Quality Data Entry (QDE) and Dedupe stages when necessary.""

Pre-Conditions for Testing:

1. The lending system must be operational and accessible to Business executives.
2. The Business executive must have an active user account and proper permissions to access the KYC module.
3. The system should have a configured integration with a DMS for document storage.
4. The system should have a designated field for capturing NPR details.
5. The system should support the creation and storage of customer records.
6. The CKYC (Central KYC) process should be integrated into the system, and there should be a mechanism for detecting CKYC failures.
7. Proper data validation rules for NPR details should be defined and configured.
8. The OSV checkbox should be visible and functional on the KYC screen.
9. The system should be capable of transitioning to the Quality Data Entry (QDE) and Dedupe stages based on the completion of the NPR capture and OSV confirmation."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements:

1. DMS (Document Management System) Integration:
   - The lending system should have a seamless integration with the designated DMS to enable the storage and retrieval of customer documents, including NPR data and Proof of Address (POA) documents.
   - The integration should support secure data transfer and storage.

2. CKYC (Central KYC) Integration:
   - The system must be integrated with CKYC services to detect CKYC failures and trigger the specific scenario mentioned in the acceptance criteria.
   - CKYC data should be accessible and utilized within the manual KYC process.

3. Data Validation Service:
   - Integration with a data validation service is required to ensure the accuracy of the NPR (national population register) data being captured.
   - The service should validate the NPR data according to predefined rules and standards.

End-to-End Integration Requirements:

1. Workflow Integration:
   - The lending system should support a seamless workflow integration, ensuring that after capturing NPR details and confirming OSV, the system progresses to the Quality Data Entry (QDE) and Dedupe stages automatically.
   - There should be a clear linkage between the KYC process stages to facilitate this transition.

2. User Role and Permission Integration:
   - The system should have integrated user role and permission management to grant Business executives the necessary access rights to perform the NPR capture and OSV confirmation.
   - Permissions should be configured in a way that allows Business executives to access only the relevant KYC features.

3. Error Handling Integration:
   - Integration with error handling mechanisms should be in place to manage exceptions during the NPR capture, OSV confirmation, and the transition to subsequent stages.
   - Errors and exceptions should be logged, and appropriate notifications should be generated for system administrators or support teams.

4. Data Storage Integration:
   - The captured NPR data and related information should be seamlessly stored within the lending system's database.
   - Data storage should be secure, compliant with data protection regulations, and accessible for retrieval and audit purposes.

5. Notification and Alert Integration:
   - The system should integrate with notification and alert mechanisms to inform relevant stakeholders (e.g., Business executives, administrators) about successful NPR capture, OSV confirmation, and progression to subsequent stages.
   - Notifications should be configurable and timely."	TC01	Business executive selects NPR as POA type	Select NPR as POA type	NPR selected as POA type	Positive
