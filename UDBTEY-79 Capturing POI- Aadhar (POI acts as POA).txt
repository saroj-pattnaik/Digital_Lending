UDBTEY-79	As a Business executive I should be able to select POI(proof of identity) type as Aadhaar Card, and capture the Primary Applicant's Aadhar number/VID via various methods so that KYC check can be run	High	Ready for review	"In this user story, a Business executive needs the capability to select the type of proof of identity (POI) for the Primary Applicant, with a focus on Aadhaar Card and Virtual ID. The purpose is to capture the Primary Applicant's Aadhaar number or Virtual ID through various methods to facilitate KYC checks within a lending application.

Pre-Conditions for Testing:
1. The user must have access to the front-end (FE) application.
2. The Loan Origination System (LOS-SFDC) and Vault integration must be functional.
3. The system should be populated with a predefined list of POI types, including Aadhaar, Driver's License, Passport, Voter ID, and NREGA.
4. Adequate test data, including sample Aadhaar numbers and Virtual IDs, should be available for testing.
5. The system should have the capability to generate reference numbers for data storage in LOS-SFDC.
6. The FE application should be capable of capturing and displaying masked Aadhaar numbers or Virtual IDs.
7. The system should have predefined field validation rules in place for POI numbers.
8. The system should be configured to automatically reduce image sizes as per system requirements.
9. The Business executive should have access to a device capable of scanning QR codes, if applicable."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements:

1. Front-End Application to Vault Integration:
  - The front-end application must integrate with Vault, the secure data storage system.
   - This integration is required to generate a reference number and securely store the Aadhaar Number as well as other relevant data.
   - The front-end application should successfully communicate with Vault, initiate the generation of reference numbers, and store the Aadhaar Number as specified.

2. Vault to LOS(SFDC) Integration:
   - Vault must integrate with the Loan Origination System (LOS-SFDC).
   - This integration is necessary for storing the reference number generated by Vault in LOS(SFDC).
   - Vault should communicate with LOS(SFDC) and provide the reference number for storage as required.

End-to-End Integration Requirements:

1. Front-End to QR Code Scanning Integration:
   - The front-end application must integrate with a QR code scanning component.
   - This integration allows the Business executive to scan the QR code of the Aadhaar card.
   - The front-end application should have a functional integration with the QR code scanning component, and it should capture the details successfully.

2. Front-End to FinTech API Integration:
   - The front-end application must integrate with the FinTech API.
   - This integration enables the automatic population of the masked Aadhaar number when scanning the QR code of the Aadhaar card.
   - The front-end application should communicate with the FinTech API and correctly auto-populate the masked Aadhaar number based on the scanned QR code.

3. Front-End to Vault Integration:
   - The front-end application must integrate with Vault.
   - This integration is necessary for initiating the generation of reference numbers and securely storing the Aadhaar Number.
   - The front-end application should successfully communicate with Vault and store the Aadhaar Number along with the reference number as specified.

4. Aadhaar Number Masking and Validation Integration:
   - The system must have an integrated component for Aadhaar number masking and validation.
   - This integration ensures that the Aadhaar number is correctly masked and follows validation rules.
   - The integrated component should mask the Aadhaar number (except the last 4 digits) and validate it according to the predefined rules."	TC-001	Business executive selects POI type.	"Select ""Aadhaar Card"" from the dropdown."	Proceeds to Aadhaar capture methods.	Positive
