UDBTEY-160	Guarantor - Manual KYC - Capturing details of the NPR (national population register)	High	Ready for review	"As a Business executive, I want to be able to capture the NPR (national population register) of a Guarantor during the manual KYC (Know Your Customer) procedure. This will allow me to conduct manual KYC when necessary.

  Preconditions for Testing  :

1.   System Environment  : The testing environment should be set up with the necessary configurations and integrations, including the Digilocker document storage integration.

2.   User Role  : The tester should have the role of a Business executive in the lending system.

3.   KYC Process  : Ensure that the KYC process is in a state where the capture of NPR information is required (e.g., after a CKYC failure).

4.   Mock Data  : Prepare mock NPR data or test NPR documents to simulate capturing and validation during testing.

5.   Testing Data  : Ensure that test data for the Guarantor, such as name and other personal details, is available for use during the test.

6.   User Interface  : The user interface should have the required elements, including the option to select NPR as the POA (Proof of Address) type and an OSV confirmation checkbox.

7.   Validation Rules  : The system should be configured with validation rules to check the accuracy and validity of the captured NPR data.

8.   Document Storage  : Verify that the integration with Digilocker is functioning correctly and that captured NPR documents can be stored and retrieved for testing.

9.   Testing Environment  : Ensure that the testing environment is isolated from the production environment to prevent any impact on real customer data.

10.   Test Plan  : Develop a comprehensive test plan that covers positive, negative, and edge cases to thoroughly validate the NPR capture functionality."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements  :

For testing the user story related to capturing Guarantor's NPR for Manual KYC, the following product-to-product integration requirements should be met:

1.   Integration with Digilocker  :
   - The lending system must be integrated with Digilocker, a document storage service.
   - The integration should allow documents, including captured NPR documents, to be securely stored in Digilocker.

2.   Data Transfer and Retrieval  :
   - The lending system should facilitate the transfer of captured NPR documents to Digilocker.
   - The integration must support the retrieval of stored documents from Digilocker when needed for verification or audit purposes.

3.   Security and Authentication  :
   - Strong security protocols and authentication mechanisms should be in place to ensure that only authorized users can access and retrieve documents from Digilocker.

  End-to-End Integration Requirements  :

In addition to the product-to-product integrations, the following end-to-end integration requirements should be met:

1.   KYC Workflow Integration  :
   - The NPR capture functionality should seamlessly integrate into the broader KYC workflow within the lending system.
   - It should coordinate with other KYC-related steps and systems to ensure a smooth end-to-end KYC process.

2.   Validation and Verification Integration  :
   - The captured NPR data should be integrated with validation and verification processes to ensure its accuracy and legitimacy.
   - Integration with OSV (Online Social Verification) processes should be in place to confirm the completion of OSV.

3.   User Interface Integration  :
   - The user interface should be integrated with the NPR capture functionality, providing users with a seamless experience for selecting NPR as the POA (Proof of Address) type and confirming OSV.

4.   Error Handling and Logging Integration  :
   - Integration with error handling mechanisms and logging services should be in place to capture and report any issues or failures during the NPR capture process.
   - These logs should be accessible for monitoring and troubleshooting.

5.   Compliance and Audit Integration  :
   - Integration with compliance and audit systems should ensure that all captured NPR data and related activities are tracked and auditable as per regulatory requirements.

6.   Testing Environment Integration  :
   - The testing environment should be integrated with a mock or test data generation system to simulate different scenarios for testing, including successful NPR captures and failures."
