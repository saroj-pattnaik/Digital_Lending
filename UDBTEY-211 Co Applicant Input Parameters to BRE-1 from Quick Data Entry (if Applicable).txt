UDBTEY-211	As a user(System), applicable data fields from Quick Data Entry(QDE) stage needs to be pushed as an input parameters for BRE-1 so that BRE can consume the feed for scheme approvals	High	Ready for review	"As a system in the digital auto lending process, I need to retrieve specific customer data from the Quick Data Entry (QDE) stage and format it correctly. This data will then be used as input for BRE-1, a Business Rules Engine, which will evaluate it for scheme approvals.

Testing Preconditions:
1. The Quick Data Entry (QDE) stage is populated with the required customer data.
2. The Business Rules Engine (BRE-1) and the Loan Origination System (LOS) are integrated.
3. Field-level input parameters for data transfer between LOS and BRE-1 are defined and documented.
4. The system has access and permission to retrieve data from the QDE stage.
5. The data format expected by BRE-1 for scheme approvals is clearly specified and accessible."	"**Product-to-Product Integration Requirements (Testing Prerequisites):**

1. **LOS to BRE-1 Integration:**
   - The Loan Origination System (LOS) must be integrated successfully with the Business Rules Engine (BRE-1) (CRIF).
   - Ensure that the integration endpoints are operational and accessible.
   - Validate that data can flow seamlessly from LOS to BRE-1.

2. **Data Mapping and Field-Level Parameters:**
   - Define and document the specific data fields and parameters that need to be transferred from LOS to BRE-1.
   - Verify that the data mapping between LOS and BRE-1 is accurately configured according to the integration sheet.

3. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Ensure that the necessary authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, tokens) are in place and properly configured for secure data transfer.
   - Validate that the system has the required authorization to access data from LOS and push it to BRE-1.

4. **Data Validation Rules:**
   - Confirm that data validation rules are established on the LOS side to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data being sent to BRE-1.
   - Verify that invalid or incomplete data is appropriately handled or rejected during the integration process.

**End-to-End Integration Requirements (Testing Prerequisites):**

1. **Quick Data Entry (QDE) Availability:**
   - Ensure that the Quick Data Entry (QDE) stage is populated with relevant customer data.
   - Confirm that QDE contains all the necessary fields, including demographic details, proof of identity and address (POI + POA), asset details, and loan information.

2. **Data Retrieval from QDE:**
   - Validate that the system can successfully retrieve data from the QDE stage.
   - Verify that the data extracted from QDE is complete and accurate.

3. **Data Formatting:**
   - Ensure that the retrieved customer data is correctly formatted according to the specified data format required by BRE-1.
   - Confirm that the formatting includes proper data type conversions if necessary.

4. **Integration Validation:**
   - Conduct end-to-end testing to verify that the data flows seamlessly from QDE to BRE-1 through LOS.
   - Confirm that there are no data loss or data corruption issues during the integration process.

5. **Input Validation on BRE-1:**
   - Check that BRE-1 (CRIF) can accept and process the incoming data according to its schema and validation rules.
   - Verify that BRE-1 can handle the data from QDE as expected and execute scheme approvals."	Scenario 1: QDE (Quick Data Entry) available to BRE-1 input
