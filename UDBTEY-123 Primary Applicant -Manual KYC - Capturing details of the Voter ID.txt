UDBTEY-123	As a Business executive I should be able to capture Primary Applicant's Voter ID during manual KYC procedure, so that the data aggregator check can be run on it	High	Ready for review	"
In this user story, a Business Executive requires the capability to capture the Voter ID of the Primary Applicant during manual KYC procedures. The system should employ OCR technology to extract data accurately, and this information is essential for a data aggregator check. Additionally, the system should enable the Business Executive to confirm Optical Scan Verification (OSV) and proceed with data retrieval via the FinTech API.

**Pre-conditions to Test:**
1. Ensure the lending system is operational and accessible.
2. Adequate test data is available, including sample Voter IDs and POI/POA documents.
3. The system UI includes a section for capturing Voter ID and checkboxes for confirming OSV and POI=POA.
4. Integration with OCR service (IDFY) and Document Management System (DMS) is set up and functional.
5. Proper OCR templates are available for data extraction from Voter IDs.
6. The system is in a state where Primary Applicant KYC needs to be completed.
7. Verify the availability of Primary Applicant information for testing purposes, including photos and details."	"ProducttoProduct Integrations:
1. Integration between User Interface (UI) and OCR Service (IDFY):
    Requirement: The UI should integrate with the OCR service (IDFY) to perform OCR on uploaded Voter ID documents.
    Details: The UI should be able to send scanned Voter ID documents to the OCR service, receive text data, and display it for verification.

2. Integration between UI and Document Management System (DMS):
    Requirement: The UI should interface with the Document Management System (DMS) to store the captured Voter ID documents securely.
    Details: The UI should upload documents to the DMS, retrieve documents as needed, and ensure data security and compliance.

EndtoEnd Integrations:
1. EndtoEnd Integration between UI, OCR Service (IDFY), and Data Validation:
    Requirement: Validate the endtoend flow from document capture to OCR processing and data validation.
    Details: Ensure that the UI can successfully send Voter ID documents to the OCR service, receive and validate OCR results, 
    and flag inaccuracies for correction.

2. EndtoEnd Integration between UI, Data Validation, and OSV Checkbox:
    Requirement: Confirm that accurate data validation triggers the autoticking of the OSV checkbox.
    Details: When OCR data is validated as accurate, the UI should automatically tick the OSV checkbox to indicate that data 
    aggregation checks will be performed.
