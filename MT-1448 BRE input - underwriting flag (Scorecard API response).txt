TC_01	Verify the FOS application parses and stores the credit underwriting flag received from the scorecard output.	Input valid credit underwriting flag from scorecard API.	Credit underwriting flag is correctly parsed and stored in FOS application.	Positive Scenario
TC_02	Verify FOS application handles invalid or null credit underwriting flag from scorecard output.	Input invalid or null credit underwriting flag.	FOS application logs the error and does not store invalid data.	Negative Scenario
TC_03	Verify the credit underwriting flag is sent from FOS to BRE correctly.	Valid credit underwriting flag stored in FOS.	BRE receives the credit underwriting flag as an input successfully.	Positive Scenario
TC_04	Verify FOS application handles failure in sending the credit underwriting flag to BRE.	Simulate a communication failure with BRE.	FOS application retries the request or logs an error message.	Negative Scenario
TC_05	Verify all business and credit deviations are displayed in FOS with the correct deviation descriptions.	Input valid deviations from BRE (e.g., business and credit deviations).	FOS displays all deviations with the correct deviation description and authority levels.	Positive Scenario
TC_06	Verify FOS handles cases where BRE does not return any deviations or returns incomplete deviation data.	BRE returns null or incomplete deviation data.	FOS application displays an appropriate message indicating no deviations or missing data.	Negative Scenario
TC_07	Verify FOS passes all business and credit deviations received from BRE to SFDC.	Valid business and credit deviations received from BRE.	All deviations are passed to SFDC along with derived highest approval authority for each deviation.	Positive Scenario
TC_08	Verify FOS handles failure scenarios in passing deviations to SFDC.	Simulate a failure in communication between FOS and SFDC.	FOS logs the error and retries passing the deviations to SFDC.	Negative Scenario
TC_09	Verify the API response from the scorecard is captured in the form of data fields within the CAM report in FOS.	Valid API response from scorecard (e.g., field names and values).	All relevant data fields are captured in the CAM report correctly.	Positive Scenario
TC_10	Verify FOS application handles cases where scorecard API response fields are missing or invalid.	Scorecard API response with missing or invalid fields.	FOS logs the issue, excludes invalid fields from the CAM report, and notifies the user appropriately.	Negative Scenario
TC_11	Verify the CAM report with scorecard data fields is passed to SFDC for underwriter review.	Valid CAM report generated in FOS.	CAM report with scorecard data fields is successfully passed to SFDC.	Positive Scenario
TC_12	Verify FOS application handles failure in passing the CAM report to SFDC.	Simulate a failure in communication between FOS and SFDC.	FOS logs the error and retries passing the CAM report to SFDC.	Negative Scenario
TC_13	Verify the FOS system derives the highest approval authority for business deviations received from BRE.	Input multiple business deviations from BRE with varying approval authority levels.	Highest business approval authority is correctly derived and displayed.	Positive Scenario
TC_14	Verify FOS system derives the highest approval authority for credit deviations received from BRE.	Input multiple credit deviations from BRE with varying approval authority levels.	Highest credit approval authority is correctly derived and displayed.	Positive Scenario
TC_15	Verify FOS application handles cases where approval authority levels for deviations are missing or invalid.	BRE returns deviations with missing or invalid approval authority levels.	FOS logs the issue, excludes invalid deviations, and notifies the user appropriately.	Negative Scenario
