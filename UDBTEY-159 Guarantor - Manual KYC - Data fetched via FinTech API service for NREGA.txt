UDBTEY-159	Guarantor - Manual KYC - Data fetched via FinTech API service for NREGA	High	Ready for review	"As a Business Executive, I want the ability to manually input and upload details from NREGA cards during the Know Your Customer (KYC) process. This will enable us to conduct Data aggregator checks on NREGA cards, even in the absence of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities. If the Data aggregator provides accurate information, it should be displayed, and if not, we will use data from the OCR service. This feature includes input fields for Consumer Number, output fields for NREGA data, and an OSV confirmation checkbox.

  Pre-Conditions for Testing  :

1.   System Configuration  :
   - Ensure that the system is configured to accept and store NREGA cards as Proof of Identity (POI) documents.
   - Verify that the OSV checkbox is present on the user interface.

2.   Integration with Data Aggregator  :
   - Confirm that the system is integrated with Data aggregators via the FinTech API.
   - Ensure that the integration is set up to fetch customer details based on the Consumer Number.

3.   Data Aggregator Responses  :
   - Prepare test scenarios to simulate different responses from the Data aggregator, including accurate responses, inaccurate responses, and no responses.

4.   Data Validation (if applicable)  :
   - Define data validation rules and criteria for accurate KYC data.
   - Ensure that data validation mechanisms are in place as per the business requirements.

5.   Consumer Number Input  :
   - Prepare test data with valid and invalid Consumer Numbers for testing different scenarios.
   - Confirm that the input field for the Consumer Number is functional and accepts valid data.

6.   OCR Service (if available)  :
   - If the OCR service is available, validate its functionality to extract data accurately from NREGA cards.
   - Prepare test data and scenarios to cover OCR functionality.

7.   Quality Data Entry (QDE)  :
   - Ensure that the QDE stage is set up and functional.
   - Define criteria for successful data entry during the QDE stage.

8.   User Interface  :
   - Validate the user interface to ensure that it displays the necessary input fields (Consumer Number), output fields (Job card number, Name of the applicant, Address), and checkboxes (OSV confirmation).

9.   Testing Environment  :
   - Prepare a testing environment that mimics the production environment to accurately simulate real-world scenarios.

10.   Test Data  :
    - Prepare test data sets that cover various scenarios, including accurate Data aggregator responses, inaccurate responses, and no responses."	"  Product-to-Product Integrations  :

1.   FinTech API Integration  :
   - Product: Lending Application (FOS, LOS-SFDC, FinnOne Neo LMS, or FinnOne Neo Collection)
   - Integration with the Data aggregator's system through the FinTech API to fetch customer details.
   - Ensure that the integration supports sending and receiving data in a structured format.

2.   OCR Service Integration (if available)  :
   - Product: OCR Service
   - Integration with the OCR service to extract data from NREGA cards.
   - Verify that the OCR service can handle NREGA card data and return it in a usable format.
   - Establish a communication protocol for sending and receiving data.

  End-to-End Integrations  :

1.   User Interface Integration  :
   - Product: User Interface (Front-End App)
   - Ensure that the user interface has been updated to include input fields for Consumer Number, output fields for NREGA data (Job card number, Name of the applicant, Address), and an OSV confirmation checkbox.
   - Verify that user interactions trigger the necessary API calls and actions.

2.   Data Aggregator Interaction  :
   - Product: Data Aggregator System
   - Integration with the Data aggregator's system to receive responses to queries based on Consumer Numbers.
   - Confirm that the Data aggregator can process requests, retrieve data, and provide responses to the FinTech API.

3.   Quality Data Entry (QDE) Integration  :
   - Product: Quality Data Entry Stage
   - Integration with the QDE stage to ensure that processed KYC data is properly captured and stored.
   - Verify that data from the Data aggregator and OCR service (if used) is correctly passed to the QDE stage.

4.   Document Storage Integration  :
   - Product: Document Management System (DMS)
   - Integration with the DMS to store captured NREGA cards and associate them with customer records.
   - Ensure that NREGA card images are stored securely and can be retrieved for future reference.

5.   Exception Handling Integration  :
   - Product: Exception Handling Mechanism
   - Integration with an exception handling mechanism to manage cases where the Data aggregator provides inaccurate or no responses.
   - Define how to fall back on OCR data and continue the KYC process."
