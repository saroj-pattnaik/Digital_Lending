UDBTEY-115	As a user (System), system should be able to capture Primary Applicant's CKYC details using their  Aadhar number/PAN number/Voter ID/Driver's License/Passport number so that the primary applicant's KYC can be completed successfully	High	Ready For Review	"As a system user (Field executive), I should be able to capture the Primary Applicant's CKYC details using their Aadhaar number/PAN number/Voter ID/Driver's License/Passport number so that the primary applicant's KYC can be completed successfully. This includes auto-populating relevant data, displaying essential customer information, and handling CKYC verification through integration with a FinTech API.

Pre-Conditions to Test:

The system should be in a functional state, and all required software components, including the FinTech API integration, should be accessible and operational.

Test data for CKYC verification, including Aadhaar numbers, PAN numbers, Voter IDs, Driver's License numbers, and Passport numbers, should be available and correctly configured in the test environment.

The CKYC verification process should be correctly set up with the FinTech API, ensuring that it responds to requests appropriately and provides CKYC data.

The system's database should be ready to store CKYC responses, timestamps, and other relevant data accurately.

User accounts with the role of Field executive should be created and have the necessary permissions to access the CKYC functionality.

The system's UI should be designed and implemented to display CKYC data accurately and intuitively to Field executives.

Error handling mechanisms for CKYC verification and data retrieval should be in place to ensure smooth testing even in case of failures or unexpected scenarios.

Document management integration should be operational, allowing access to customer documents provided during CKYC for review.

The system should be configured to initiate manual KYC processes if CKYC fails, and this functionality should be thoroughly tested as part of the test cases.

Test cases for positive, negative, and exceptional scenarios, as well as test data, should be prepared and organized for efficient testing of the CKYC process."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements:
