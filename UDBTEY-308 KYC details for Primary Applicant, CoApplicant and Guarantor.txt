This enhancement ensures that all customer-related KYC information is readily visible to Business executives, streamlining their workflow.

Pre-Conditions to Test:
1. A functional Front-End (FE) application is available for testing.
2. The Quality Data Entry (QDE) stage has been successfully completed with relevant KYC data for the customer.
3. Field-level validations defined in the DDE (Data Definition and Extraction) worksheet have been configured in the FE application.
4. Business executives have appropriate access rights and privileges to view KYC details.
5. The Business executive is logged into the FE application.
6. The user has navigated to the KYC details section and clicked on the down arrow to initiate the pre-population."	"Product-to-Product Integration Requirements:

   - The FE application should be able to fetch KYC data from the QDE system.

2. KYC Data Validation: Implement a mechanism to validate the KYC data received from the QDE system to ensure its completeness and accuracy.
   - Define validation rules and logic for KYC data.

3. Error Handling: Establish error-handling procedures for handling communication failures or data discrepancies between the QDE system and the FE application.
   - Define error codes, messages, and logging mechanisms.

4. Access Control: Set up access control and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users, such as Business executives, can access the KYC data.
   - Define user roles and permissions.

End-to-End Integration Requirements:

1. User Journey: Define the end-to-end user journey that includes the steps leading to and following the KYC details section.
   - Specify the workflow from logging in to completing the Asset details section.

2. Data Flow: Document how data flows through the entire lending process, from the QDE stage to the Asset details section.
   - Identify data sources, transformations, and destinations.
