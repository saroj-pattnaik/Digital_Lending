This will enable me to conduct the KYC check efficiently and securely.
Pre-conditions to Test:

The Frontend (FE) App should have the required feature built to support the selection of Aadhaar as a POI type.
The system should integrate with a Vault system to generate reference numbers for storing Aadhaar data securely in the Loan Origination System (LOS) - SFDC (Salesforce.com).
Proper field validations and checks should be implemented for Aadhaar numbers and Virtual IDs.
The system should be capable of scanning QR codes from Aadhaar cards.
The system must correctly mask Aadhaar numbers, revealing only the last four digits.
The system should automatically resize images to meet system requirements.
The system should prioritize Aadhaar as the preferred POI type.
This user story aims to enhance the KYC process by allowing Business executives to efficiently capture Aadhaar information, ensuring data security and compliance with validation rules, while offering multiple data capture methods for ease of use.
